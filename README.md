A macOS app bundle that launches Neovim inside Kitty.

I made this primarily to have Neovim in a separate application with its own icon
that I could switch to with the macOS task switcher. Furthermore, Kitty gives
multiple windows out of the box, which was the one thing I missed when using
Neovide.

Icon taken from:

## Installation

Clone this repository to, e.g., `$HOME/Applications/Neovim.app`:

```sh
git clone git@github.com:tamstrup/neovim-mac-bundle.git Neovim.app
```

You should now be able to launch the application.
